# GitHub-Search

A simple app that allows a user to search Organizations on GitHub.com and see repositorys and contributors for that organization.

To Run: 
-Clone the repo
-`cd GitHub-Search`
-`npm install`
-(Until further notice - related to webpack -v) Will need to move `config-optimist.js` and `convert-argv.js` into `node_modules/webpack/bin/`
-`npm run dev`

Project will then be seen on `localhost:8081`
